# Flaky LibriSpeech

This dataset is constructed by training a character-based [Conv1d-LSTM](https://github.com/proger/haloop) on train-other-500 and train-clean-360 and decoding train-clean-100 after every epoch. The intended use of this system is training active learning / utterance verification systems.

The run that resulted in this data: https://wandb.ai/stud76/ha/runs/3i0kv0vf

The code for the model and training is available in [haloop commit e7b6fe7](https://github.com/proger/haloop/tree/e7b6fe7b8b2efa0c21fa0227b0e5267846fc302f). Implementation of Bootstrapped Likelihood is available in the [main branch of haloop](https://github.com/proger/haloop)

This dataset contains 28539 utterances. Later experiments use 28538 utterances without the first one.
